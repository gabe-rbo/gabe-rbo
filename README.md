# Pleasure to Meet You

I'm Gabriel, a mathematics student and programmer at UFMG. I code for my Scientific Initiation projects and Extension Project. Here are a few things about myself:

- I speak Portuguese, English (C1), Spanish, and German.
- Some code is written in Portuguese, others in English.
- Code can be found in Python and Prolog.
- I research heuristics, symbolic artificial intelligence, and the democratization of math games.

Feel free to contact me as needed.
